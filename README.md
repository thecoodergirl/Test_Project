# Test_Project

This Program is about weather the number is odd or even.
A number is even if it is perfectly divisible by 2. When the number is divided by 2, we use the remainder operator % to compute the remainder. If the remainder is not zero, the number is odd.
In this program, we ask the user for the input and check if the number is odd or even.
